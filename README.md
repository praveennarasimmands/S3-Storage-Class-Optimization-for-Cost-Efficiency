# **S3 Storage Class Optimization for Cost Efficiency**

### **Problem Statement**

In industries such as **Media & Entertainment**, **Healthcare**, and **Government**, managing storage costs is crucial. Data access patterns vary, and organizations need to optimize storage costs while ensuring compliance and performance. 

- **Media & Entertainment**: Store large video files, raw footage, and archives in cost-effective storage classes like **S3 Glacier** for long-term storage and retrieval.
- **Healthcare**: Store archived medical records and patient data in **S3 Glacier Deep Archive** for compliance with retention policies.
- **Government**: Government agencies must store historical records in a way that ensures long-term accessibility at a low cost while meeting compliance requirements.

### **Solution Overview**

We will implement **S3 Storage Classes** to optimize costs by moving data between different storage tiers based on access patterns:
1. **S3 Standard**: For frequently accessed data.
2. **S3 Intelligent-Tiering**: For data with unpredictable access patterns.
3. **S3 Glacier**: For archival data that is infrequently accessed.
4. **S3 Glacier Deep Archive**: For long-term, low-cost storage of data that is rarely accessed.

Additionally, **Lifecycle Policies** will be used to automate transitions between these storage classes.

## **Domains**

- **Media & Entertainment**: Store video and audio files in **S3 Glacier** and transition them when no longer frequently accessed.
- **Healthcare**: Archive patient data in **S3 Glacier Deep Archive** to comply with long-term retention requirements.
- **Government**: Store historical records in **S3 Glacier** or **S3 Glacier Deep Archive** for cost-effective, long-term storage.

  ## **How We Will Solve This**

1. **Set up S3 Lifecycle Policies**: Automatically transition data from **S3 Standard** to **S3 Glacier** or **S3 Glacier Deep Archive** based on access patterns and retention policies.
2. **Use S3 Intelligent-Tiering**: Automatically move data between the **Frequent Access** and **Infrequent Access** tiers based on usage, ensuring cost efficiency without manual intervention.
3. **Monitor and optimize costs**: Use **AWS Cost Explorer** and **AWS Budgets** to track storage usage and optimize costs over time.

## **Steps for Setting Up S3 Storage Classes**

### **1. Install Required Dependencies**

Ensure that **Boto3** is installed, as it is required to interact with AWS S3.

```bash
pip install boto3
```

### **2. Set Up Lifecycle Policies**


#### **s3_lifecycle_policy.py**

Lifecycle policies will automate the transition of data between different storage classes based on the data's access patterns.


### **3. Set Up S3 Intelligent-Tiering**


#### **s3_intelligent_tiering.py**

Use **S3 Intelligent-Tiering** for data with unpredictable access patterns, ensuring that it moves between **Frequent Access** and **Infrequent Access** storage classes automatically.


### **4. Logs**

Logs for lifecycle policy applications and transitions are written to `logs/lifecycle_logs.txt` for tracking purposes.

## **How to Use the Scripts**

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/s3-storage-optimization-project.git
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Configure AWS credentials** using the **AWS CLI** or by adding them in the `~/.aws/credentials` file.

4. **Configure your S3 bucket details** in `config/s3_config.py`.

5. **Apply the lifecycle policy** by running:
   ```bash
   python s3_lifecycle_policy.py
   ```

6. **Enable S3 Intelligent-Tiering** by running:
   ```bash
   python s3_intelligent_tiering.py
   ```

7. **Monitor lifecycle policy logs** in the `logs/lifecycle_logs.txt` file.

## **Conclusion**

This solution optimizes **S3 storage costs** for **Media & Entertainment**, **Healthcare**, and **Government** by automating the transition of data between storage classes based on access patterns. By using **S3 Glacier**, **S3 Glacier Deep Archive**, and **S3 Intelligent-Tiering**, organizations can efficiently store and archive data while minimizing costs. **Lifecycle policies** automate transitions, and **Intelligent-Tiering** ensures data is always stored in the most cost-effective class, without sacrificing access performance.
